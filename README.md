# puca-tools
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/icbat/puca-stats.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/icbat/puca-stats)

A collection of tools I've built for my own Puca use.

## puca-addresses

This is a tool I use to build a CSV to Mail Merge in to label software to easily print a bunch of addresses.

### How to use it

1. Copy and paste the javascript in to your browser's console (`Ctrl Shift I` in Chrome, or `Ctrl Shift K` in Firefox)
2. Execute the code, which should append further instructions to the header area of the page
3. Wonder why this isn't easier to run, figure it out, and submit a pull request to fix it ;)

## puca-stats

This will ideally be a way to export historical data from pucatrade for visualization somewhere else.
